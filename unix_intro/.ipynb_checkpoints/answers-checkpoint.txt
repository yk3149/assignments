1. How many earthquakes are listed in the table?
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ tail -n +2 signif.txt.tsv | wc -l
    5958

2. How many columns are in the table?
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ head -n 1 signif.txt.tsv | tr '\t' '\n' | wc -l
    47

3. Use the cut command to create a new file that just has the data from the columns for YEAR, EQ_PRIMARY and COUNTRY. 
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ cut -f3,10,18 signif.txt.tsv > Year_Mag_Country.tsv

4. EQ_PRIMARY is the assigned earthquake magnitude. With your new file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv', sort the data based on the numeric value of the EQ_PRIMARY column, then list the lines for the top ten largest earthquakes.
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ (head -n 1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv && tail -n +2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort -t$'\t' -k2,2nr | head -n 10)
    YEAR    EQ_PRIMARY      COUNTRY
    1960     9.5    CHILE
    1964     9.2    USA
    2004     9.1    INDONESIA
    2011     9.1    JAPAN
    1700     9.0    USA
    1952     9.0    RUSSIA
    1716     8.8    PERU
    1812     8.8    USA
    2010     8.8    CHILE
    1513     8.7    PERU

5. How many unique countries are listed in the database? Use cut,sort,uniq, wc and a few pipes | to form a single expression that answers this question.
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ tail -n +2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | cut -f3 | sort | uniq | wc -l
    153

6. Use the grep command to count how many earthquakes in the database are located in the USA or USA TERRITORY
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ tail -n +2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | cut -f3 | grep -c "USA"
    294

7. Expanding on the previous exercise, refine your command sequence so that it only counts earthquakes in the USA and not ones in USA TERRITORY. 
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ tail -n +2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | cut -f3 | grep "USA" | grep -v "USA TERRITORY" | wc -l
    255

8. Compute the total number of earthquakes in each country and then display the top ten countries along with the number of earthquakes. Hint: this can be done with a command sequence similar to exercise 5, but requires a specific argument to be used with uniq.
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ tail -n +2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | cut -f3 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 10
        579 CHINA
        400 JAPAN
        365 IRAN
        363 INDONESIA
        324 ITALY
        319 TURKEY
        259 GREECE
        255 USA
        207 PHILIPPINES
        193 MEXICO

9. Create a shell script named countEq.sh that returns the total number of earthquakes for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Hint: see the Shell Script notes and use the special variable $1. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country USA.

countEq.sh contents:
    #!/bin/bash
    COUNTRY="$1"
    tail -n +2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | cut -f3 | grep -Fx "$COUNTRY" | wc -l

Terminal commands:
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ ./countEq.sh USA
    255

10. Create a shell script named countEq_getLargestEq.sh that returns both the total number of earthquakes AND the largest earthquake for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Use the echo command before each command to create labels for each returned value. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country CHILE.

countEq_getLargestEq.sh contents:
    #!/bin/bash
    COUNTRY="$1"
    
    echo "Total earthquakes:"
    tail -n +2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | cut -f3 | grep -Fx "$COUNTRY" | wc -l
    
    echo "Largest earthquake (YEAR<TAB>EQ_PRIMARY<TAB>COUNTRY):"
    tail -n +2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep -P "\t${COUNTRY}$" | sort -t$'\t' -k2,2nr | head -n 1

Terminal commands:
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ chmod +x countEq_getLargestEq.sh
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ ./countEq_getLargestEq.sh CHILE
    Total earthquakes:
    192
    Largest earthquake (YEAR<TAB>EQ_PRIMARY<TAB>COUNTRY):
    1960     9.5    CHILE

11. Compute the total number of earthquakes each year and then output a sorted list of the top ten years with the most earthquakes. Paste your command and the top ten list below.
    yk3149@chopin:~/assn2$ tail -n +2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | cut -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 10
     78 2004
     77 2008
     72 2003
     67 2007
     62 2010
     61 2006
     60 2009
     60 2005
     60 2002
     59 2011
